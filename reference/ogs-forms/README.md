Office of Graduate Studies Documents
====================================

This directory contains forms obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies (OGS) that need to be filled out for completion of the thesis. This directory has two subdirectories: `orig` and `filled`. The `orig` directory contains the original forms obtained from OGS. The `filled` directory is where you need to put the forms (in PDF format) when you have filled them out.

The guidelines document in the `orig` directory describes the guidelines for writing a thesis, and is the basis for this repository.

To get started, open the following documents in Microsoft Word (not LibreOffice or any variant):

- Title Page
- Approval Form
- Scholarworks Submission Form

Fill them out, taking care to get the formatting exactly as you want it to look. After filling them out, export to PDFs using word. Save them under the following names under the `filled` directory:

- `titlepage.pdf`
- `approval.pdf`
- `scholarworks.pdf`

When this is finished, run the build. The build system will pick up on these files and insert them into your final document.
